<h3>"actually, i dont give two shits if you die or not."</h3>
<i>the protagonist of welcome to the game 2, a reporter whos determined to search the deep web for the location of his coworker.</i>

<p>okay so i REALLY like clint. rlly rlly. hes one of those faceless, silent protagonist types. but he does talk more in dead signal and get a face reveal... of sorts. hes my silly little guy...</p> 

<p>ive been slowly getting more and more obsessed with him (cant really tell you when it started) and hes honestly gaining a spot in my heart. my babygirl boyfailure</p> 

<p>hes overall a great protagonist i feel, and its definitely interesting to look into him (and the entire game), and why hes so good yet so bad at the same time. id give you something more in-depth, but... i dont feel like it. PLAY THE GAME!!!</p>

<p>i dont have much else to add. live laugh love clint edwards</p>
